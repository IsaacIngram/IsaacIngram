Hello, I'm Isaac...
=====
And you have found my GitHub. I'm currently a senior and high school, and I am interested in software development. 

My GitHub contains personal projects as well as stuff for my robotics team.

If you want to, you can visit [my website](https://isaacingram.dev) (currently undergoing a renovation and therefore not viewable).
