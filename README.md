Hello, I'm Isaac
=====
I'm a Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.

My GitHub contains personal projects, classwork, and code I wrote for my highschool robotics teams (FRC team 5889 and FTC team 6042).

If you would like to get in touch with me, feel free to email me at me@isaacingram.dev. You can also find my resume and other ways to contact me on my website.
